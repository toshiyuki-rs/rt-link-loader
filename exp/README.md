# Jsfiddle example

I started from here to create jsfiddle example. To show example, I compile a
library to get CSSStyleSheet from global object which is named mainCssLib.
The library and css are uploaded into unpkg cdn repository.
In jsfiddle, I get the assets by link and script tag, I get global mainCss
object and use it in javascript.


[Here is result](https://jsfiddle.net/toshiyuki_rs/rmq3ujfh/)
